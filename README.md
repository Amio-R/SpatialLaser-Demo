# SpatialLaser - Demo
## Project Overview
Apply centroid based calculation to find total population and average income from given radius and location for block groups given in the database. Click on the map to choose your location and use the input slider to determine the radius that will be used to find statistics for average income and total population.  
## Frontend
Frontend was built using Next.js, React.js, Leaflet, react-leaflet and Tailwind CSS.
## Backend
Backend was built using Springboot, Java, Postgres and other dependencies. 

## Further Improvements In The Future
Apply draw tool to allow users to interact more effectively with the map. Double click and drag to change radius accordingly. Apply calculation with Areal Proportion method.
